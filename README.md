# Open Source Software Licenses for general use 

- [UwU-NoAI-NoAIDerivatives](UwU-NoAI-NoAIDerivatives) - Based on the [NON-AI-MIT License](https://github.com/non-ai-licenses/non-ai-licenses/blob/main/NON-AI-MIT) by Aleksandar Prokopec (original license included)
    - Restricts use in AI training and datasets and also restricts use in work that involves AI prompting.

## To-do:

- create license with exemptions for traditional machine learning (eg: face/body tracking technology, etc.). Will need to be very careful about vocabulary for this purpose.
